# ðŸ“š Book Chain

## Project Description
**Book Chain** is a decentralized application (DApp) that allows authors and book owners to register, store, and transfer book ownership records securely on the blockchain.  
Each book is uniquely identified and permanently recorded, ensuring transparency, authenticity, and traceability of ownership.

---

## Project Vision
To create a trustless, immutable, and open registry for book ownership and publication rights â€” empowering authors and readers through blockchain transparency.

---

## Key Features
- **Register Books:** Authors can register their books with title and author name.
- **Ownership Transfer:** Current owners can securely transfer ownership to another address.
- **Immutable Records:** Book data and history remain transparent and unaltered on-chain.
- **Decentralized Storage:** All book records are stored on the Ethereum blockchain for reliability.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with IPFS for decentralized storage of book content.
- Author verification through decentralized identity (DID).
- Marketplace for book trading and NFT-based ownership representation.
